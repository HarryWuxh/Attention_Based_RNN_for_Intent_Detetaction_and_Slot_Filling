# Attention_Based_RNN_for_Intent_Detetaction_and_Slot_Filling
This is a tensorflow implementation of paper *Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network Models for Joint Intent Detection and Slot Filling*.  
In this implementation, encoder is implemented with tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn and decoder with attention is implemented with tf.contrib.seq2seq.
